Learning styles are very important to know and utalize, if you're a student or teacher. If you are teaching, you should know if your students learn better with visual, auditory, reading/writing, or kinesthetic teaching. If you're a student, knowing which learning style helps you the most will help when studying. You can also use it in deciding which career to go into. I'm a visual learner, and I'm going into filmmaking for my career. I am, at the moment I'm typing this, just realizing that fact. So, yeah, here's the evidence to back that up. Learning what your learning style is will indeed help if you don't know what to do in the future.
