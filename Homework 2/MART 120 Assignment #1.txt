I have a list of goals that I want to accomplish in my life. One, be integral in the creation of a film that is seen by nearly everybody that changes the world for the better. Two, live a fun life. The film industry is very challenging to be a part of, so my first goal will be very difficult. But he tried and got rejected many times, but eventually, he achieved his goals, even if they weren't exactly how he imagined. I think that if I'm trying to go for ym first goal, my second goal will come to pass.
	The lecture was very emotional and definitely touched me. I was affected most by his steadfastness in his goals he set early on. Since I started college, I realized there's really nothing left in the future for me unless I create it. From now on, I need to make my own paths and follow them, like he did. I wanted to be a spy when I was younger, mainly for all the cool equipment. Who knows, maybe I'll play one in a future bond film, or a new spy film. Those are bound to make a comeback in a couple years. No matter how many rejections, I'll keep trying, like he did, and find success.
