GUI, or Graphical User Interface is a visual way of presenting info, commands, tools, etc.. This interface requires a high usage of a mouse, more than keyboard. CLI, or Command-Line Interface, on the other hand, requires much less, to no mouse usage. As it's name suggests, it is entirely lines of commands, where you type for everything. I prefer GUI because I am a much more visual thinker. I prefer graphs to equations in math, so an interface that shows me everything in an easy to use format, where I can see things move and order things easily, rather than keep things in my head while I type.
