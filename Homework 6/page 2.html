        <h1>Short Story</h1>
        <h1>The man who stole the crayons</h1>

        <p>Once, a man was strolling down the street. He spotted a child playing with crayons.</p>
        
        <p>Immedietly, the man sprinted at the child, like a dolphin to whatever the dolphin is about to kill.</p>
        
        <p>He grabbed the crayons, and pushed the child into the grass. The child was upset. The man didn't care.</p>
        
        <p>The man, now with crayons in his hand, marched on down the street, flooding with testosterone and whatever makes dolphins feel proud after killing a defensless baby seal.</p>
        
        <p>Suddenly, a giant, red object fell out of the sky. The wax crushed the man, as the crayons flew out of his hand and back to the child, who had moved on to eating dirt in the grass.</p>
        
        <p>It was a giant red crayon. The cracked street underneath the butt of the massive crayon, was red. For obvious reasons.</p>
        
        <p>"Don't do that," The crayon gods boom from the clouds, "It's rude". The End.</p>
